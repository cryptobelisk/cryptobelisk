Hello,
I am a full stack developer, I love coding and I am experienced in website development,
I am also an artist, therefore I enjoy web designing since I am experienced with colours, it helps me to create fantastic web designs. 

I am also an experienced English teacher specially for IELTS preparations, I have had many students in group classes and privately. 

Also as my hobby, I paint on procreate, I love creating brushes and sometimes even painting.
